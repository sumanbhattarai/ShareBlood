Share Blood is a web application with the objective to solve the blood shortage problem. In order to mitigate the problem faced by the victim of not getting the blood in time from the blood banks, hospitals can use Share Blood website in order to retrieve the name of the donors from the nearest location. The people interested in blood donation can register themselves in the site at an ease.

# BACKGROUND
Blood shortage is a serious problem these days. Developing countries face chronic shortages of blood which particularly affect especially children and women. The number of accidents and injuries requiring blood transfusion is growing worldwide. (World Health Organization, 2006). Share Blood provides the environment to register the interested donors name. Hence, at the time of scarcity of the blood in the bank, Hospitals can use Share Blood website to retrieve the name of the interested donors living near to the hospital. Donor after donating the blood to the hospital may choose whether they further want or do not want to donate in future. They can choose as their wish and hospital can update the database accordingly. Donors must have a minimum gap of 3 months from their last donation in order to register themselves.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many Blood banks of Nepal are running out of blood. Many people are dying of not getting the blood in proper time. Only conducting frequent blood donation programs cannot solve this problem. Demand of blood is increasing rapidly especially in developing nation. (World Health Organization, 2006). So, Share Blood can provide a significant role in uprooting this problem of the nation.

# OBJECTIVES
The major objectives of our project are:
- To create a suitable environment for the people who are eligible in donating blood to register themselves.
- To create hospital account system for the hospitals and health clinics.

# IMPLICATION
Share Blood aims to solve the shortage of bloods on the blood bank. Many people are dying by not getting blood in time. Someone needs blood every two seconds. One pint of blood can save up to three lives (Seymour, 2015). Our project provides an easy environment for the people who are willing to save a life by donating blood to register themselves as blood donor of the certain location. After they have registered their identity, their information is stored in our server. When there comes the case of not getting the blood from the bank, Hospitals or other health clinics can sign up in the Share Blood website and hence can retrieve the name of the donors nearby them.
